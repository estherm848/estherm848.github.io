		<h3> CUSD Against Racism </h3>
			<p> Capistrano Unified School District Against Racism is a coalition of current and former students that came together in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement to demand anti-racist reform from Capistrano Unified School District (CUSD). Over the course of the past few month we have: 
				Collected over 850 personal accounts of racism in CUSD schools and received nearly 2,000 signatures on our Open Letter
				Organized a rally and spoke at five District Board meetings with testimonies of racism and proposals for change
 				Engaged thousands of community members on our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and website, 
				Created task forces of students and teachers dedicated to combating racism at each high school
 				Worked with students, teachers, CUSD PTSA, the teacherâ€™s union, the Cultural Proficiency Task Force and Executive Cabinet, members on the Board of Trustees, and more to share our experiences and brainstorm ways the District can create more positive learning environments for students of all racial and ethnic backgrounds</p>
